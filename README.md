## General info
Application written by me in 2015 as part of the study of the course of algorithms.
It's a game like wide known Three-in-a row or Jewels, where our task is to find bubbles that can be lined up three in a row.
Using mouse, we can move the bubble to an adjacent position. Three bubbles in a row disappear, the remaining bubbles fall, 
filling their places, new bubbles appear on top. The game has a smooth pleasant animation of moving bubbles, as well as a time countdown and scores.
